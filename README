Based on DMMs and Wiimms excellent work, I've created a flexible patchscript
for GNU/Linux. Patchimage is a script that allows to patch riivoluton, ips
or xdelta patches into wbfs or iso images of legal game dumps, ROMs or dumped
cpk files.

features include:
 - downloading riivolution files or patches
 - downloading soundtracks (if available)
 - downloading custom banners for Wii games (if available)
 - downloading covers for Wii games (if available)
 - automatic storing of patched games into desired destination (see README.RC)
 - automatic patching of Wii games, 3DS games, Wii U games
 - replacing characters, fonts and items in Mario Kart Wii
 - replacing characters in New Super Mario Bros. Wii
 - replacing first players Kirby in Kirby's Adventure Wii
 - patch Nintendo WFC compatible games to use WiimmFi server

NOTE: don't fiddle around with sub-folders in riivolution-files, the script uses
files as "unzip" creates them. No need to modify anything.

You need the original games to do this legally, if you don't own the original,
you can't blame me. patchimage is 100% legal, as it does not contain any
propritary contents, nor is able to grab them.

patchimage supports the following base games:
	* New Super Mario Bros. Wii
	* Kirby's Adventure Wii
	* Mario Kart Wii
	* Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE
	* Pokemon X
	* Pokemon Y
	* Pokemon Omega Ruby
	* Pokemon Alpha Sapphire
	* Bravely Second

More information:
	* supported game modifcations, search paths and expecte file names
		see README.GAMEIDS
	* supported commandline flags
		see README.CMD_OPTS
	* configuration file example
		see README.RC
	* status code while processing
		see README.STATUS_CODES
	* exit codes (for debugging)
		see README.EXIT_CODES

Example usages:

	Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii
	$ patchimage --game=NewerSMBW --iso=/home/test/SMNP01.iso --download

	Zelda: Parallel Worlds
	$ patchimage --game=ParallelWorlds --rom=/home/test/ALTTP.smc --download

	Toyko Mirage Sessions #FE Restoration
	$ patchimage --game=TMSFE --xdelta=/home/test/xdelta/ \
		--cpk=/home/test/ASEP01/content/Pack/
