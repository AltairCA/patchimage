Based on DMMs and Wiimms excellent work, I've created a flexible
patchscript for GNU/Linux. Additionally to riivolution patches, this
one will also allow patching ROMs using ips/ppf patches. And more...

patchimage allows choosing a custom GAMEID, aswell as downloading
riivolution-files, patches and soundtrack (if available).

NOTE: don't fiddle around with sub-folders in riivolution-files, the
script uses files as "unzip" creates them. No need to modify whatever.

... Well, you need the original game to do this legally, if you don't
own the original, you can't blame me. patchimage is 100% legal, as it
does not contain any propritary contents, nor is able to grab them.

More information:
	* supported games: 		see file README.GAMEIDS
	* supported commandline flags:	see file README.CMD_OPTS
	* configuration file example:	see file README.RC
	* status code while processing:	see file README.STATUS_CODES
	* exit codes (for debugging):	see file README.EXIT_CODES

Default searchpaths:

    ISO: BASE.iso / BASE.wbfs / GAMEID.iso / GAMEID.wbfs
    Riivolution: Original name of the zip / unpacked folder
    ROM: some mask matching the file (eg: "*[Ll]ink*[Pp]ast*smc" for Zelda: Parallel Worlds)

Example usage:

NewerSMBW:
$ patchimage --game=NewerSMBW --iso=/home/test/SMNP01.iso --download

Zelda: Parallel Worlds
$ patchimage --game=ParallelWorlds --rom=/home/test/ALTTP.smc --download
